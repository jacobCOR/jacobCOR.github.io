> When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't. 

I am a computer science graduate student with a heavy industry background in CV and data engineering. I also like playing Video Games in my freetime. The focus of this blog is primarily about topics that interest me and games I play or random side projects I have time for.

The quote above is from Alan J. Perlis' [Epigrams on Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/947955.1083808).
