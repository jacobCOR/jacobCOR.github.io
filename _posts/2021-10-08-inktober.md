While drawing for Inktober, today's phrase was *Watch* I was reminded by a movie I recently watched called Inception. While sketching a scene from the movie for Inktober, I was reminded of the beautiful fractals on display visualizing time and recursion.

Mandelbrot sets are generated from iterating on a set of complex numbers, c, which are bounded in absolute value by the function ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/191627a3eebdd6608c9b226786defc468b747502)
These can generate unique fractal patterns and can be infinitely bounded and can create unique geometries.


# Generated Fractals

This is the most basic fractal pattern it shows the edges of fractals and bounds before the complex number becomes unstable.

This shows the evolution of boundaries of one pass to a multipass generation. This is a clever way of showing the stability of a system through its passes

# Generation of Mandelbrot Sets
Generating Mandelbrot sets in code is quite trivial to understand. Per pixel you can recursively calculate the subtrees of that pixel up to a maximum depth _(n=1000) is the depth I used_. This can be quite slow because you are calculating similar problems for the same pixel. Tired of waiting for large images to generate I sped this up by throwing GPUs at the problem. 

```python
# ty Alexmano98 for the amazing GPU implementation.  
def mandelbrot(c0, img, max_depth=1000): 

    # Initialize c
    c = torch.zeros((c0.shape[0], c0.shape[1]), device=device)

    # tracker to remember which pixels have already been modified
    tracker = torch.zeros((c0.shape[0], c0.shape[1]), device=device)

    pixels = torch.tensor(np.array(img), device=device, dtype=torch.int64)

    for i in range(1, max_depth): 

        mask = torch.logical_and(torch.abs(c) > 2, tracker == 0)

        # the color function generates colors for touched pixels
        pixels[mask] = torch.tensor(color(i),device=device, dtype=torch.int64)

        # Update tracker
        tracker[mask] = -1

        # Avoid overflow by setting c and c0 to 0 for pixels we've already set
        c[mask] = 0
        c0[mask] = 0

        c = c * c + c0 


    # Set remaining pixels to black
    pixels[tracker == 0] = torch.tensor((0,0,0), device=device, dtype=torch.int64) 

    return pixels
```
Applying tensors allows us to use a GPU to speed up the calculation. You can seperate out the calculation per pixel parallelizing the problem and creating faster calculations. "Zooming in" is a matter of translating to a boundary and applying a zoom factor.

Thank you [Alexmano98](https://github.com/Alexmano98) for the late night GPU implementation.
